  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Peace Warriors Organisation (PWO) was realized in 2015 and registered in 2018 with NGO Coordination Board of Kenya as a non-governmental organization, with over 40,000 members cutting across the 47 counties in Kenya. PWO is the brainchild of Jayne Waithitu after working with women organizations and in education in both Kenya nd Rwanda at various capacities for over 15 years. As a girls' secondary school principal for several years, she experienced first hand the problems girls face in life. While working with a women organization in Rwanda, she saw women realize their economic actualization through co-operatives and sports.</p>
  <p>In Kenya, working in a project aimed at promoting women's participation as election candidates, Jayne came into contact with the true picture on the ground of what women aspiring or seeking political seats go through, starting from rejection by partners and family, tribalism, voter bribery, change of narrative at the last minute - particularly on the eve of election - and insecurity. Her passion to see women in decision making positions drove her into uniting women from all the 47 counties in Kenya. The perceptions soon began to touch the minds of many women.</p>
  <p>Even though many organizations in Kenya are on the ground doing capacity building and advocacy for women just one year to elections, none addresses itself to other dynamics that are very crucial like visibility and tribalism long before the electioneering period.</p>
  <p>Women are tribe-less as they can marry into any tribe, but when it comes to being elected to decision-making posts, they are labelled "newcomers". Thus, denied the opportunity to lead.</p>
