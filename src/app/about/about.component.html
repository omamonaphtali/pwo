  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Peace Warriors Organization (PWO) was realized in 2015 and registered in 2018 with NGO Coordination Board of Kenya as a non-governmental organization, with over 40,000 members cutting across the 47 counties in Kenya. PWO is the brainchild of Jayne Waithitu after working with women organizations and in education in both Kenya and Rwanda at various capacities for over 15 years. As a girls' secondary school principal for several years, she experienced firsthand the problems girls face in life. While working with a women organization in Rwanda, she saw women realize their economic actualization through co-operatives and sports and live peacefully after genocide.</p>
  <p>Peace is prerequisite to life and development. Challenges of life are not necessarily found on the outside, but need to come from within. It is this search of answers from within, which is filled with simplicity that results to peace. With no development, poverty reigns. Gender is the most significant predictor of poverty and powerlessness. Gender inequality remains a pervasive and fundamental obstacle to human development and society as a whole, and the guarantee of universal human rights. To remedy this, Peace Warriors Organization being a women-led organization believes that women are agents of peace and change thus development. PWO wish to see gender balance in governmental bodies and committees, as well as in public administrative entities. PWO wish to see women steering the economic wheel in their society and Kenya as a whole. PWO wish to see government setting targets and implementing measures to substantially increase the number of women in all governmental and public administration positions for Peace and change and especially in economic decision making.</p>
  <p>Peace work of PWO includes mobilizing and providing technical backstopping for critical peace agents to intervene in peace processes; conducting training for young men used for violence against women and girls especially during the elections in income generating small projects and restorative justice; and, facilitating vulnerable categories of people, particular PLWD, widows, orphans, etc. to organize in groups for self-development and effectively access rehabilitative services.</p>
  <p>PWO’s services to post-conflict communities include rehabilitating and strengthening social institutions for sustainable peace; facilitating establishment of ‘connector projects’ for productive engagement of people in the context of associational life in order to strengthen relationships and build mutual trust; and building capacities of vulnerable groups to engage in sustainable livelihoods and uphold their dignity.</p>
